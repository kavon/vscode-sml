## Development

In the root of this project's directory:

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`

2. Run the TypeScript compiler with `tsc`. This will compile
   the extension and place it in the `out` directory. See `tsconfig.json`
   for details about how this is built.

3. Launch VSCode, open the project root directory, and hit Debug to launch.
